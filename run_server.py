    Windows Scheduled Task / redirected-console stdout defaults to the
    system ANSI codepage (commonly cp1252), which cannot encode Turkish
    characters such as the "s,"/"i" combinations in this module's own
    startup message. An otherwise-successful startup print then raises
    UnicodeEncodeError and kills the process before Waitress ever binds
    the port -- proven directly on the live Windows Server 2019 Scheduled
    Task "BYS360 Live Waitress 80": the task showed as Running, the
    process died on this exact print, port 80 never opened, and health
    checks failed. Reconfiguring stdout/stderr here (rather than just
    ASCII-sanitizing this one print) removes the locale dependency for
    every subsequent print/log call made through this process, not only
    this module's own message.

    Fails safe: if reconfigure isn't available or fails for any reason on
    a given stream, startup must still proceed unchanged -- an operator
    message must never be able to crash the app by itself.
