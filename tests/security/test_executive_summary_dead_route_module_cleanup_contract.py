"""BYS360 Executive Summary Dead Route Module Cleanup -- contract test.

CONTEXT: `app/dashboard/executive_summary_routes.py` defined THREE distinct
route groups (not just the one daily-weather-mail pair already handled by
a prior, separate wave):

    1. `/dashboard/yonetici-ozeti` (GET) -> `executive_summary_dashboard()`
       -> would have rendered `dashboard/executive_summary.html`.
    2. `/dashboard/yonetici-ozeti/send-test` (POST) ->
       `executive_summary_send_mail()`.
    3. `/executive-summary/daily-weather-mail` +
       `/yonetici-ozeti/gunluk-hava-maili` (GET/POST) ->
       `executive_summary_daily_weather_mail_tasks_v1_3_1()` -> would have
       rendered the already-deleted `executive_summary/daily_weather_mail_
       tasks.html` (see "BYS360 Daily Weather/Mail Orphan Template
       Temizliği").

INDEPENDENT RE-VERIFICATION (not assumed from the prior wave's finding):
a real, isolated `create_app()` proved:
    - `app.dashboard.executive_summary_routes` is absent from `sys.modules`
      -- neither `app/dashboard/routes.py` nor `app/dashboard/__init__.py`
      import it, and a repo-wide grep for any real `import`/`from ...
      import` of this module (excluding the module's own self-referential
      logging strings) returns zero hits.
    - `/dashboard/yonetici-ozeti` [GET] resolves to a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT,
      genuinely live module: `executive_summary.yonetici_ozeti` in
      `app/executive_summary/routes.py` (registered directly in
      `app/__init__.py::create_app()` via `app.register_blueprint(
      executive_summary_bp)`, `url_prefix="/dashboard"`). This is a real
      URL COLLISION between the dead file's claimed route and a genuinely
      live one -- the live one wins because the dead module's decorators
      never execute.
    - `/dashboard/yonetici-ozeti/send-test` [POST] has NO live equivalent
      at all -- 404.
    - `/executive-summary/daily-weather-mail` and `/yonetici-ozeti/gunluk-
      hava-maili` resolve to `main.daily_weather_mail_settings` in
      `app/communication/daily_weather_mail_routes.py` (already
      established by the prior daily-weather-mail orphan cleanup).
    - The real `url_map`'s sorted-endpoint-list SHA-256 and route count are
      BYTE-IDENTICAL before and after this module's deletion (985 routes,
      hash `624e25c447915f9eaf68c8583b80e962236dcecbea962259a1a21604bb48a94a`)
      -- this dead module never contributed a single runtime endpoint.

FILE-INTERNAL DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS: every symbol defined in the dead file
(`_ADMIN_ROLE_TOKENS`, `_normalize`, `_safe_actor_id`,
`_is_system_admin_user`, `system_admin_required`, `_v3_enrich_context`, and
the three view functions) was independently grepped repo-wide; the only
external hits were coincidental same-name-but-unrelated symbols in other
files (an independently-defined `_ADMIN_ROLE_TOKENS` constant in
`app/services/bys360_notification_bridge.py`; the string
`executive_summary_dashboard` appearing only as a menu-key ALLOWLIST ENTRY
in `app/menu_registry.py`, never as a `url_for()`/import reference) -- not
real dependencies. The service module it imported from,
`app/services/executive_summary_service.py`
(`build_executive_summary_context`, `send_executive_summary_mail`), has
NO other consumer either (confirmed absent from `sys.modules` too) --
it was left UNTOUCHED regardless, since deleting a service file was not
part of this task's declared scope (a candidate for a future, separate
cleanup, not acted on here). `app/templates/dashboard/executive_summary.
html` (the dead dashboard route's own template) was likewise left
UNTOUCHED for the same reason.

DELETED: `app/dashboard/executive_summary_routes.py` (150 lines, 3 route
groups, all confirmed unreachable).

PRESERVED (all explicitly out of scope, AT THE TIME): `app/services/
executive_summary_service.py`, `app/templates/dashboard/executive_summary.
html`, the real `app/executive_summary/` package, `app/communication/
daily_weather_mail_routes.py`, `app/dashboard/routes.py`,
`app/dashboard/__init__.py`, `app/route_registry.py`, all launcher/
installer scripts, CSS/JS, CSP/nonce, meeting templates.

FOLLOW-UP (BYS360 Executive Summary Artık Servis/Template Temizliği, a
separate, later wave -- the two tests below that used to assert these two
files still EXIST have been converted to absence contracts): the residual
candidates flagged above (`app/services/executive_summary_service.py` and
`app/templates/dashboard/executive_summary.html`) were independently
re-verified in that follow-up wave -- still zero application/CLI/test
consumers of either, real isolated `create_app()` still 985 routes /
byte-identical endpoint SHA, `/dashboard/yonetici-ozeti` still resolves to
the same live `executive_summary.yonetici_ozeti` view rendering
`executive_summary/yonetici_ozeti.html` (a completely different template
from the deleted `dashboard/executive_summary.html`) -- and BOTH files were
then deleted. `RESIDUAL_CLEANUP_PRE_DELETION_REF` below is the commit
immediately before that follow-up wave's own deletion (this file's own
commit, `c5a6a61b47caf2d39ca812b74f7fd22f329629c4`, HEAD at the time).

This file writes NOTHING to app/template/CSS/config sources -- only
`Path.read_text()`, `git show` (read-only), and real Flask
`app`-fixture-based `url_map`/route-resolution checks (no HTTP POST, no
mail/task code ever invoked).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# BYS360 Executive Summary Artık Servis/Template Temizliği (the later
# residual-cleanup follow-up wave, see module docstring) deleted 1 more
# confirmed-orphan template (app/templates/dashboard/executive_summary.html),
# removing 3 static style="..." attributes and 1 <style> block:
# 1040 - 3 = 1037, 248 - 1 = 247. See tests/security/test_csp_style_
# migration_cumulative_inventory_contract.py's
# DELETED_TEMPLATE_WAVES["executive_summary_dashboard_cleanup"] for the
# independently re-derived evidence. The residual service `.py` file
# carried no template markup, so it contributes 0 to this ledger. A further
# later wave (BYS360 Workflow Orphan Presentation Subsystem Temizliği)
# deleted 14 more confirmed-orphan templates (2 full trees of 7), removing 2
# more static style="..." attributes, 2 dynamic style="..." attributes, and
# 14 more <style> blocks: 1037 - 2 = 1035, 66 - 2 = 64, 247 - 14 = 233. See
# that same ledger file's
# DELETED_TEMPLATE_WAVES["workflow_orphan_presentation_cleanup"]. Neither
# of this wave's own deleted files (app/workflow/routes.py,
# app/workflow/dashboard_upgrade_routes.py) carried template markup either.
# A further later wave (style3c_meeting_family_group_a) extracted 8 more
# <style> blocks from 8 active templates (no static/dynamic attributes
# touched): 233 - 8 = 225. See that same ledger file's
# STYLE_MIGRATION_WAVES["style3c_meeting_family_group_a"]. A further,
# unrelated later wave (weights_orphan_template_cleanup) deleted the orphan
# app/templates/weights.html, which independently carried its own one static
# style="..." attribute and one <style> block: 1035 - 1 = 1034, 225 - 1 = 224.
# See that same ledger file's FORWARD-COMPATIBILITY FOLLOW-UP 7. A further,
# unrelated later wave (weight_create_edit_orphan_cleanup) deleted the two
# sibling orphans app/templates/weight_create.html and
# app/templates/weight_edit.html, each independently carrying one static
# style="..." attribute and one <style> block: 1034 - 2 = 1032,
# 224 - 2 = 222. See that same ledger file's FORWARD-COMPATIBILITY
# FOLLOW-UP 8. A further, unrelated later wave (BYS360 Settings Center V2)
# added 4 new templates, but their CSS is an external stylesheet with no
# inline style="..." attributes or <style> blocks, contributing 0 -- totals
# remain 1032/222. See that same ledger file's FORWARD-COMPATIBILITY
