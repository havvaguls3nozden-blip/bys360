"""BYS360 CSP inline-style migration — cumulative, wave-agnostic repo-wide
inventory contract.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: `test_csp_style2a_repo_wide_contract.py` originally
carried its own repo-wide "active total == 1235 - N" / "<style> block total
== 272" locks. Those assumed Style-2A was the last wave that would ever
touch a `style="..."` attribute anywhere in the repo. When Style-2B
legitimately removed 58 more static style attributes from 8 *other*
templates, those locks failed — not because anything was wrong, but
because they were never designed to accommodate a second wave. See that
file's own docstring for the full incident writeup.

This file is the replacement: a single, wave-agnostic, manifest-driven
cumulative contract. Every wave registers itself in
`STYLE_MIGRATION_WAVES` with the templates it touched and how many fully-
static attributes it removed from them. The expected repo-wide total is
always ``INITIAL_ACTIVE_STYLE_TOTAL - sum(wave.removed_static for wave)``.
Adding a Style-2C, Style-2D, ... wave later means adding one manifest
entry here — nothing else in this file changes.

FORWARD-COMPATIBILITY FOLLOW-UP (Style-3A, same class of bug as the
Style-2A/2B incident above, fixed the same way): this file originally also
hardcoded a single, wave-agnostic-in-name-only "`style_block_total` always
equals `INITIAL_STYLE_BLOCK_TOTAL`" lock in `test_cumulative_style_block_
total_is_unchanged`. That was true for Style-2A/2B (both attribute-only
waves that never removed a `<style>` BLOCK, only `style="..."` attributes)
but is false in general — Style-3A is the first wave whose entire purpose
is removing `<style>` blocks (10 of them, by design: see
`test_csp_style3a_duplicate_block_extraction_contract.py`). Exactly like
`CUMULATIVE_REMOVED_STATIC` above, block removal is now a per-wave manifest
field (`removed_blocks`) summed into `CUMULATIVE_REMOVED_BLOCKS`, and the
expected total is ``INITIAL_STYLE_BLOCK_TOTAL - CUMULATIVE_REMOVED_BLOCKS``
(renamed to `test_cumulative_style_block_total_matches_manifest` to match
the naming of its active-attribute sibling). Style-2A/2B's entries simply
carry `removed_blocks: 0`, so their expected total is unaffected.

FORWARD-COMPATIBILITY FOLLOW-UP 2 (orphan template deletion, a new wave
CLASS this manifest did not originally support): `STYLE_MIGRATION_WAVES`
above assumes a wave EDITS a template in place (the file still exists
afterward, now with zero static attrs/blocks) — that assumption is baked
into `test_every_wave_target_template_has_zero_active_style_attribute` and
`test_every_block_removal_wave_target_template_has_zero_style_blocks`,
which both `.read_text()` every listed template. A wave that instead
DELETES a template entirely (its whole rendering surface was dead code —
see the "BYS360 Executive Mail Orphan Alt Sistemi" cleanup: a route module,
`app/communication/executive_mail_center_routes.py`, proven absent from
`sys.modules`/`route_manifest.py`/the real `url_map` after `create_app()`,
whose only 6 templates therefore had zero reachable renderer) would make
those two tests raise `FileNotFoundError`, not a clean assertion failure.
`DELETED_TEMPLATE_WAVES` below is a separate, parallel manifest for exactly
this wave class: same `removed_static`/`removed_blocks` shape, folded into
the SAME `CUMULATIVE_REMOVED_STATIC`/`CUMULATIVE_REMOVED_BLOCKS` sums (so
`EXPECTED_ACTIVE_STYLE_TOTAL`/`EXPECTED_STYLE_BLOCK_TOTAL` account for both
wave classes uniformly), but checked by its own
`test_every_deleted_wave_target_template_is_genuinely_absent_from_worktree`
(asserts the file is GONE, the inverse of the edit-in-place check) and its
own `test_deleted_wave_removed_static_and_removed_blocks_match_pre_deletion_
git_ref` (independently re-derives `removed_static`/`removed_blocks` from
the fixed git ref immediately before the deletion commit, so the recorded
numbers are never just trusted). `INITIAL_ACTIVE_STYLE_TOTAL` /
`INITIAL_DYNAMIC_STYLE_TOTAL` / `INITIAL_STYLE_BLOCK_TOTAL` and the
`STYLE_MIGRATION_WAVES` entries above are untouched by this follow-up —
they are historical fact about waves that already landed, not affected by
a later, unrelated wave deleting different, always-dead templates.

FORWARD-COMPATIBILITY FOLLOW-UP 3 (Style-3B, an ordinary edit-in-place wave
— back to the original `STYLE_MIGRATION_WAVES` shape, no new manifest
needed): a new `"style3b_low_risk"` entry was added with `removed_static=0`,
`removed_blocks=2` for its 2 templates (`performance/meeting_development.
html`, `performance/meeting_p3_reminders.html`, both genuinely `ACTIVE` —
independently re-verified with a real, isolated `create_app()` before this
wave touched anything). Note this wave was originally scoped to 4 templates
across 2 groups; the second group (`executive_summary/daily_weather_mail_
tasks.html` + `communication/daily_weather_mail_settings.html`) was dropped
entirely after the same pre-implementation re-verification proved both of
those templates are ORPHAN (see
`tests/security/test_csp_style3b_low_risk_duplicate_extraction_contract.py`'s
own module docstring for the full evidence) — neither was touched in any
way, so this ledger has no entry for them. `INITIAL_*` constants and the
`style2a`/`style2b`/`style3a`/`DELETED_TEMPLATE_WAVES` entries above are
unaffected.

FORWARD-COMPATIBILITY FOLLOW-UP 4 (BYS360 Daily Weather/Mail Orphan
Template Temizliği, a DELETED_TEMPLATE_WAVES-class wave): a new
`"daily_weather_mail_cleanup"` entry was added recording the deletion of
the exact 2 templates dropped from Style-3B's scope above (both
independently re-confirmed ORPHAN, not just assumed) plus 2 more
(`daily_mail_tasks_premium.html`, `daily_mail_tasks_v1_4.html`, already
correctly identified as orphan by Wave 8's own original contract).
`removed_static=20`/`removed_blocks=4` are the sum of each of the 4
templates' independently-measured, identical per-template contribution (5
static attrs + 1 block each) — see
`tests/security/test_csp_wave8_weather_mail_contract.py` and
`tests/security/test_csp_wave8_executive_summary_mail_contract.py`'s own
module docstrings for the full per-template evidence and the correction of
a previously-incorrect "CANLI" (live) claim for one of the four. `INITIAL_*`
constants and all prior wave entries are unaffected.

FORWARD-COMPATIBILITY FOLLOW-UP 5 (BYS360 Executive Summary Artık
Servis/Template Temizliği, a DELETED_TEMPLATE_WAVES-class wave): the prior
"dead route module" wave (`app/dashboard/executive_summary_routes.py`
removal, commit `c5a6a61b`) had deliberately left `app/services/
executive_summary_service.py` and `app/templates/dashboard/executive_
summary.html` untouched as an explicitly out-of-scope residual candidate
(neither had any OTHER consumer even then). This follow-up wave
independently re-verified both are still ORPHAN_CONFIRMED with a real,
isolated `create_app()` (985 routes, byte-identical endpoint SHA before and
after) and a repo-wide consumer grep (zero application/CLI/test consumers
of `app.services.executive_summary_service` beyond the file's own
self-referential log strings; zero `render_template`/`include`/`extends`
reference to `dashboard/executive_summary.html` anywhere — the live
`/dashboard/yonetici-ozeti` route, registered from the unrelated
`app/executive_summary/` package, renders a completely different template,
`executive_summary/yonetici_ozeti.html`). The deleted template also
referenced a nonexistent `url_for('main.executive_summary_send_mail')`
endpoint, which would have raised a `BuildError` had it ever actually been
rendered — further evidence it had no live renderer to begin with. Added a
new `"executive_summary_dashboard_cleanup"` entry: `removed_static=3`,
`removed_blocks=1`, independently re-derived from the fixed pre-deletion
git ref (see `DELETED_TEMPLATE_WAVES_PRE_DELETION_REF`). The deleted
service `.py` file carried no template markup, so it contributes 0 to this
style/CSP ledger. `INITIAL_*` constants and all prior wave entries are
unaffected.

CANONICAL METHODOLOGY: all counting goes through the single shared helper
`tests/security/_bys360_style_inventory.py` (real `html.parser.HTMLParser`
based tokenization, not a naive regex) so this file, the per-wave files,
and any future wave's contract test can never silently disagree about what
counts as a real `style="..."` attribute. See that module's docstring for
why a naive regex is unsafe here (JS `<script>` template-literal strings
containing literal `style="..."` text as DATA, not a real attribute; and
`{% if x %}style="..."{% endif %}` bare-Jinja-mid-tag fragments that a raw
`HTMLParser` loses sync on and silently drops).

SCOPE: exactly `app/templates` + `app/modules/*/templates` +
`app/workflow/templates` (Flask/Jinja render roots). `app/static` (PWA
offline HTML, served as static files, never Jinja-rendered) and anything
under `scripts/` (not part of the Flask app at all) are deliberately
excluded — mixing them in previously caused scope-consistency bugs (see
`_bys360_style_inventory.py` and `test_csp_style2a_repo_wide_contract.py`
docstrings for the specific files/line numbers that were affected).

INITIAL BASELINE EVIDENCE: `INITIAL_ACTIVE_STYLE_TOTAL` /
`INITIAL_DYNAMIC_STYLE_TOTAL` / `INITIAL_STYLE_BLOCK_TOTAL` are measured
directly (canonical helper, `compute_inventory_at_git_ref`) against git
commit `dab2c1de08024bd330f4c15eeffc089dbbcd8b2e` — the immediate parent of
`649f4530...` (the squashed "Style-1 + Style-2A" checkpoint), i.e. the
repo state before ANY inline-style migration wave touched anything.
`test_initial_baseline_constants_match_historical_git_ref` re-derives them
from that commit at test-run time (not from a cached number) so this
baseline can never silently drift from its own evidence. That test skips
only if the `git` binary itself is unavailable (an environment limitation,
not a correctness gap) — it is NOT gated on there being any uncommitted
diff, so it runs identically on a clean, fully-committed worktree.

NO SKIP-ON-CLEAN-WORKTREE ANYWHERE IN THIS FILE: every test here compares
the *current on-disk worktree* against fixed manifest arithmetic. None of
it depends on `git status`/`git diff` having anything pending, so it
behaves identically before and after this wave's own commit lands.
