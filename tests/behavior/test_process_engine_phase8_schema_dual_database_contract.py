"""BYS360_DEFECT_AI_PHASE8_SCHEMA_DUAL_DATABASE_CONTRACT

Regression contract for Defect AI: app/services/performance/
process_engine_phase8_tracking.py's ``apply_phase8_schema()`` runtime
schema-repair helper called ``_add_column()``, which issued raw
``ALTER TABLE {table} ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS {column} {type}`` --
PostgreSQL-only syntax, despite this same file's own dual PostgreSQL/SQLite
support contract (``table_exists``/``_table_columns``/``column_exists``
dialect-branching helpers already present for exactly this reason).

Mechanical SQLite reproduction (real, disposable, in-memory sqlite3 --
performed once during triage, not part of this permanent suite):

    >>> import sqlite3
    >>> conn = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")
    >>> conn.execute("CREATE TABLE t (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY)")
    >>> conn.execute("ALTER TABLE t ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS foo VARCHAR(80)")
    sqlite3.OperationalError: near "EXISTS": syntax error

This fails UNCONDITIONALLY on SQLite -- not merely "when the column already
exists" -- so every one of ``apply_phase8_schema()``'s 11 ``_add_column``
calls (9 on performance_process_flows, 2 on performance_process_flow_steps)
made the whole function completely unusable under a SQLite-backed app.
CLASSIFICATION: CONFIRMED DEFECT (not NOT_A_DEFECT).

Fix: ``_add_column`` now calls this same module's own dialect-neutral
``column_exists()`` first and only issues a plain ``ALTER TABLE ... ADD
COLUMN`` (portable to both dialects -- SQLite has supported this exact
subset since long before any version this project targets) when the column
is actually absent -- preserving idempotency without depending on
PostgreSQL-only ``IF NOT EXISTS``. Column types/defaults/nullability strings
themselves are byte-for-byte unchanged; only the existence-check mechanism
changed. No other Phase8 schema behavior was touched.

A one-time real, disposable local PostgreSQL 15 database verification
(created, exercised -- including a full second idempotent pass -- and
dropped in the same session, matching the established convention already
used for Defects AB/AC/AD in this same phase; this repo's permanent suite
does not require a live PostgreSQL server) confirmed the identical guarded
ALTER pattern adds every column on the first pass and is a clean no-op on
the second, both against real PostgreSQL syntax/semantics.

This file is the SQLite half of that same two-part verification -- the
concrete regression proof that was previously impossible (calling
apply_phase8_schema() under SQLite could not even complete without raising).

NEW FINDING AJ (reported, NOT fixed here -- out of AI's exact named scope,
"process_engine_phase8_tracking.py" only): while building this test's
fixture, apply_phase8_schema()'s own (pre-existing, unchanged) UPDATE
statement was found to reference several performance_process_flows /
performance_process_flow_steps columns (president_status,
current_owner_user_id, current_stage, last_action_title, process_version,
status, step_code) that the current SQLAlchemy ORM model classes do not
declare at all. Tracing where these actually come from surfaced the SAME
"ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS" defect class, independently reimplemented, at
several more call sites not named in AI's ledger entry:
  - app/services/performance/process_engine_phase3_history.py (status,
    step_code on performance_process_flow_steps)
  - app/services/performance/process_engine_phase4_flow.py (current_stage,
    current_owner_user_id, last_action_title, process_version, and others)
  - app/services/performance/process_engine_phase6_president_approvals.py
  - app/services/performance/process_engine_phase7_president_rule.py
    (raw literal ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS strings, not even
    routed through a shared _add_column helper)
A repo-wide grep for the same literal pattern also found it in
app/schema_guard_patches.py, app/schema_guard_core_maintenances.py,
app/services/cic/celebration_service.py, app/services/cic/cic_context.py,
and app/api/mobile/services/performance_note_route_services.py -- none of
these were individually triaged for SQLite-compatibility intent in this
pass (schema_guard_*.py in particular were previously documented, in
migration c51c29032d4f's own docstring, as an intentionally PostgreSQL-
production-only legacy self-heal fallback -- that framing was NOT
independently re-verified here and should not be assumed). This test's
fixture works around the phase3/4/6/7 gap by adding the prerequisite
columns directly via plain SQLite DDL (see the `app` fixture below), so it
exercises ONLY the actual AI fix (_add_column / apply_phase8_schema()
itself) under test.
