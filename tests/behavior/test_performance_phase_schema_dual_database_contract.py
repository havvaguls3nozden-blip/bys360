"""BYS360_DEFECT_AJ_PERFORMANCE_PHASE_SCHEMA_DUAL_DATABASE_CONTRACT

Regression contract for Defect AJ (performance-phase family): the same
PostgreSQL-only ``ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`` defect Defect
AI fixed in app/services/performance/process_engine_phase8_tracking.py's
``_add_column`` was independently reimplemented in four sibling schema-
repair functions:

  - process_engine_phase3_history.py::ensure_phase3_columns()
  - process_engine_phase4_flow.py::apply_phase4_schema() (plus its
    table_exists/column_exists/_table_columns helpers, which were ALSO
    PostgreSQL-only raw information_schema queries with no dialect branch
    at all -- these failed even earlier than the ADD COLUMN statements)
  - process_engine_phase6_president_approvals.py::apply_phase6_schema()
    (identical structure/bug to phase4)
  - process_engine_phase7_president_rule.py::ensure_phase7_schema() (raw
    literal ALTER strings, not routed through a shared _add_column helper)

Mechanical SQLite reproduction (real, disposable, real Flask app + real
SQLite -- performed once during AJ triage, not part of this permanent
suite):

    >>> apply_phase4_schema()
    sqlite3.OperationalError: no such table: information_schema.tables
    >>> ensure_phase7_schema()
    sqlite3.OperationalError: near "EXISTS": syntax error

CLASSIFICATION: AJ_CONFIRMED_DEFECT for all four files.

Fix (same shape as Defect AI, applied consistently): each file's own
existence-check helper (table_exists/column_exists, or a small local
existence-check for phase7, which had none) is now dialect-neutral --
phase4/phase6's raw ``information_schema`` queries were replaced with
SQLAlchemy's ``inspect()`` (dialect-neutral by construction, the same
pattern already proven safe in phase3's own ``_table_exists``/``_columns``
and in Defect AI's fix). Every ``ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`` was replaced
with an explicit existence check followed by a plain ``ADD COLUMN`` only
when the column is actually missing. ``CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS``
statements (valid, dialect-portable syntax on both databases) were left
untouched everywhere -- they were never part of this defect.

Cross-phase dependency note (discovered while building this test, not a
new defect): these four functions assume a real deployment calls them in
order -- phase3, then phase4, then phase6, then phase7 -- each adding
columns (e.g. phase3 adds performance_process_flow_steps.owner_user_id
and .status; phase4's own CREATE INDEX statements reference them) that a
LATER phase's schema function assumes already exist. This mirrors the
same cross-phase dependency already documented for Defect AI's own test
fixture (tests/behavior/test_process_engine_phase8_schema_dual_database_
contract.py). This file therefore always calls the phase functions in
that same real order, never in isolation.

Shared-helper decision: each file keeps its OWN local existence-check
implementation (not a new shared cross-module utility) -- these four
files (plus phase8) have always maintained independent, self-contained
schema-repair helpers; introducing a new shared module purely for this
fix would be exactly the "broad refactor" this closure explicitly avoids,
and importing phase8's private helpers into earlier-numbered phase files
would be a backwards, confusing dependency direction.

A one-time real, disposable local PostgreSQL 15 database verification
(created, exercised, dropped in the same session, matching the
established convention used throughout this project's AA-AI closure)
confirmed the identical guarded-ALTER pattern still works correctly
against real PostgreSQL, in both the missing-column and idempotent-second-
call cases -- this repo's permanent suite does not require a live
PostgreSQL server.
