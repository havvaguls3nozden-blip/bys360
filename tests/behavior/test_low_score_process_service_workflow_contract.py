"""BYS360_PHASE5_AGENT1_WORKFLOW_CONTRACT

Behavioral contract tests for app/services/performance/low_score_process_service.py,
focused on the state-transition surface that
tests/services/test_low_score_process_service_phase4t.py does not already cover:

- The live, currently-imported president approve/reject entry points
  (`president_approve_process`, `president_reject_process`) and the auto-escalation
  they trigger (`auto_record_first_low_score_warning` /
  `auto_start_second_low_score_process`) for a genuine first-offense vs.
  second-offense (repeat) low score, exercised through a real Flask app context +
  real SQLite database -- not mocks. These are the exact functions
  app/performance/low_score_process_routes.py imports and calls for the
  Başkan/Üst Onay approve/reject screens; the module's numerous
  `_legacy_*_phase1/phase2/phase3` twins are NOT imported by any route or other
  service (confirmed via `grep -rn "president_approve_process\\|president_reject_process\\|
  record_first_warning\\|start_second_repeat_admin_process" app/ --include=*.py`), so
  they are intentionally not exercised here as a second, redundant layer.
- Real state-transition behavior when president approve/reject is called against a
  process that is NOT in the "fresh, pending" state (reject-after-approve,
  approve-after-reject) -- documenting what the real code actually does (transitions
  unconditionally, no raise, no silent no-op) rather than assuming a guard exists.
- `record_first_warning` / `start_second_repeat_admin_process` called directly
  (as the "/record-warning" and "/start-admin-process" admin routes do) against a
  process whose `sequence_no`/`president_approved_at` do not match the scenario the
  function name implies -- these two primitives carry no such guard themselves (only
  the `auto_*` wrappers do), which is real, non-obvious behavior worth locking in.
- `calculate_sequence_no`'s documented fallback (always 1) when the low-score schema
  is not deployed yet.
- The real end-to-end publish-lock release flow through the live
  `get_low_score_employee_publish_lock_reason` / `is_low_score_employee_publish_released`
  aliases (used by app/services/performance/visibility_guard.py and
  app/services/performance/personnel_support_publish_approval_service.py).

A confirmed, separate production defect was found in the `ensure=False`
path of `get_low_score_publish_block_reason` while writing this file
(it never looks up an already-existing PerformanceLowScoreProcess row for
that path, so a genuinely finalized low-score evaluation can stay reported
as locked). That defect is deliberately NOT characterized by any test in
this file -- doing so would assert the current, incorrect behavior as the
expected passing outcome, which would break the moment the defect is
correctly fixed. It is tracked separately for a controlled defect wave
(correct failing regression -> minimal production fix -> regression green
-> full gates), not mixed into this behavioral-contract suite.

# finalized low-score evaluation stays reported as locked/not-visible) as
# the test's own expected-passing outcome -- meaning a correct future fix to

# tracked for a separate, controlled defect wave (correct failing
# regression -> minimal production fix -> regression green -> full gates);
# it is deliberately not characterized here so this wave's suite cannot be
# read as having blessed the current, incorrect behavior.
