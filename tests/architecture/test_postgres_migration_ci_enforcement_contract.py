"""TD-032 closure -- PostgreSQL 15 migration-integrity CI enforcement contract.

Locks in that the real-PostgreSQL migration-integrity gate
(``scripts/quality/bys360_postgres_migration_integrity_gate.py``) is not
just a local ad-hoc script but genuinely wired into
``.github/workflows/bys360-ci.yml``: a ``postgres:15`` service container is
present, the gate is actually invoked (not merely referenced in a comment),
it does not use production secrets, it is not marked ``continue-on-error``
(an allow-failure step would make the gate decorative), and the pre-existing
Step1/Step2 pytest commands are unchanged by this addition -- this is meant
to be a purely additive CI change, not a rewrite of the existing gates.
