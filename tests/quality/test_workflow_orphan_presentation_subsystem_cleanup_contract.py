"""BYS360 Workflow Orphan Presentation Subsystem Temizliği -- düzeltilmiş
Alternatif A+ cleanup contract.

CONTEXT: a prior, separate read-only audit ("BYS360 Workflow Alt Sistemi
Runtime Aktiflik, Test Kirliliği ve Orphan Kapsam Denetimi") independently
proved the entire `app/workflow/` presentation/route package was dead code:

    - `app/workflow/routes.py` (1218 lines, 12 `@main_bp.route(...)`
      decorators) was NEVER imported by any startup/bootstrap/application
      code -- only two test files imported it directly:
      `tests/workflow/test_phase5w_workflow_schema_readiness.py` and
      `tests/workflow/test_generic_sync_sql_identifier_phase5u.py`.
      `"app.workflow.routes"` appeared in `app/route_registry.py`'s
      `_BASE_MODULAR_ROUTE_MODULES` tuple, but that tuple is only ever
      returned by `get_runtime_route_manifest()` as documentation/metadata
      -- never iterated over to perform a real `importlib.import_module()`
      call (the REAL blueprint-registration mechanism is
      `app/bootstrap/route_bootstrap.py::CORE_BLUEPRINT_SEQUENCE`, which
      never listed `app.workflow` at all).
    - `app/workflow/dashboard_upgrade_routes.py` (its own separate
      `workflow_dashboard_upgrade_bp` Blueprint) was likewise never
      registered.
    - All 12 of `routes.py`'s claimed URLs resolved to a genuine 404 in a
      real, isolated `create_app()` -- none were SHADOWED by another live
      view at the same URL.
    - Both template trees (`app/templates/workflow/*.html` and
      `app/workflow/templates/workflow/*.html`, 7 filenames each, 6/7
      byte-identical between the two trees) had zero reachable renderer:
      `routes.py`'s own `safe_render()` calls (the only would-be consumer of
      the first tree) never executed since the module was never imported;
      the second tree was only reachable via `workflow_dashboard_upgrade_bp`
      's blueprint-scoped `template_folder`, and that blueprint was never
      registered either.
    - `app/services/workflow/dashboard_upgrade.py` (`demo_dashboard_data`,
      `build_performance_map`, `build_delayed_managers`,
      `build_risky_personnel`) had zero consumers besides the two dead route
      files above.
    - Directly importing `app.workflow.routes` in-process (as the two now-
      deleted test files did, at MODULE level -- meaning pytest's own
      COLLECTION phase, which imports every test file up front before any
      test function runs, triggered it regardless of file/test ordering)
      permanently mutated the shared, module-level singleton `main_bp`
      Blueprint object in `app.route_registry`: every subsequent
      `create_app()` call in that SAME process afterwards saw 997 routes
      instead of 985 (the 12 extra endpoints from `routes.py`'s
      decorators), with a different sorted-endpoint-list SHA-256. A fresh,
      separate process was unaffected -- independently reproduced with a
      real A(clean)/B(dirty)/C(re-clean) three-state experiment.

DELETED (this wave, düzeltilmiş Alternatif A+):
    - app/workflow/routes.py
    - app/workflow/dashboard_upgrade_routes.py
    - app/workflow/__init__.py (and the now-empty app/workflow/ directory)
    - app/services/workflow/dashboard_upgrade.py
    - 14 templates: app/templates/workflow/{dashboard,delays,
      executive_dashboard,modules,notifications,president_approvals,
      timeline}.html + app/workflow/templates/workflow/{same 7 names}.html
    - tests/workflow/test_phase5w_workflow_schema_readiness.py and
      tests/workflow/test_generic_sync_sql_identifier_phase5u.py (and the
      now-empty tests/workflow/ directory) -- both tested ONLY functions
      defined inside the now-deleted app/workflow/routes.py
      (`assert_workflow_schema_ready`/`ensure_tables`,
      `_sync_generic_table`); there is no meaningful "absence contract" for
      unit tests of business logic that no longer exists anywhere -- the
      route file's own deletion (and this contract file's evidence of it)
      IS the absence contract.
    - The single `"app.workflow.routes"` entry in `app/route_registry.py`'s
      `_BASE_MODULAR_ROUTE_MODULES` tuple (the inert-but-misleading manifest
      string that made the dead module look like a live, tracked candidate)
      -- nothing else in that file was touched.

PRESERVED (explicitly out of scope, independently re-verified below, NOT
the same thing despite sharing the word "workflow"): `app/services/workflow/
{constants,state,visibility,transitions,__init__}.py` (a completely
unrelated concept -- an EVALUATION state machine, consumed by
`app/services/evaluation_workflow_service.py` -> `app/services/query_health/
workflow_meta.py` + `app/services/performance/evaluation_form_service.py`),
`performance_president_approvals` (a real, shared, actively-referenced-in-30
-files database table and its whole process-engine service/model chain),
all migration files (`migrations/versions/6f2b8c4d1a90_*` and
`5a7c9e1f2b30_*`, which own the `workflow_instances`/`workflow_steps`/
`workflow_logs`/`workflow_notifications`/`performance_president_approvals`
schema -- untouched; those tables simply have zero live application code
reading/writing them now, same as before this wave, since only
`app/workflow/routes.py` -- itself always-dead -- ever touched them).

This file writes NOTHING to application/template/CSS/config sources -- only
`Path.read_text()`/`.exists()`, `git show` (read-only), and real, isolated
subprocess `create_app()`/pytest-collection probes (no HTTP POST, no mail/
task code ever invoked, no shared session-scoped `app`/`client` fixture
relied upon for anything that could be polluted by import ordering).

#
# TD-032 fix (2026-08-16): the two tests below used to compare a fixed
# historical git ref (PRE_CLEANUP_REF) against the *current* directory
# listing / working tree -- a hardcoded EXPECTED_MIGRATIONS_VERSIONS_COUNT
# = 72 that the CURRENT directory had to match forever, and a file-SET
# comparison against the CURRENT directory listing. Both forms conflate
# "did this 2026-08-06 workflow-cleanup wave touch migrations/versions/?"
# (a fixed historical fact) with "is the migrations directory identical to
# some frozen count/set *right now*, regardless of any later, unrelated
# wave?" (which drifts every time any legitimate migration is added --
# exactly what the later, real TD-032 migration-graph-repair work did).
# Fixed the same way as the companion fix in
# tests/security/test_duplicate_template_orphan_cleanup_wave1_contract.py:
# compare PRE_CLEANUP_REF against POST_CLEANUP_REF -- both fixed, historical
# commits bracketing this wave's own single atomic commit (5401195's only
# parent is PRE_CLEANUP_REF, and its own migrations/versions/ diff against
# PRE_CLEANUP_REF is empty) -- so both assertions are permanent,
# working-tree-independent facts about what that one commit did, and stay
# true no matter how many legitimate migrations are added later.
